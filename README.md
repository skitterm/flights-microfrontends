# flights-microfrontends

Microfrontends for the flight booking application. This demonstrates that different bundles can be used together but deployed separately.

## To use

The application consists of 5 microfrontends, each in their own folders: `shell`, `header`, `viewFlights`, `searchFlights`, and `design-system`. These are the "microfrontend directories" mentioned below.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install#global-install) globally
1. In a terminal, run `yarn` at the project root
1. Run `yarn` at each microfrontend directory
1. In each microfrontend directory, run `yarn start`
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the prototype
